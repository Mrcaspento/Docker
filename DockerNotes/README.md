## Development WorkFlow

Works around Github repo it will have two dif branches a `feature` which will be the one we add code to and make changes to
then we have a `master` branch which will be our clean and employed code

\*\* Note
I can delete the node_modules folder after I run `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .` but when I run that code again it builds alot faster becuase the container has those files already

Any time you want expose a port from our port to our machine we need the `-p <portid>:<portid> <Image-ID>` tag

## Docker Volume

Volumes are a preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. While bind mounts are depenedent on the directory structure and OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.

- Bascially we are setting up a mapping froma folder inside the container to a folder outside the container

when You run the code below and runinto a error like "docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint sweet_bohr (0efbf995ca50c9100e3cfd9bc50d6d7887e3bb111d99b4e3e631a80eabcd3cbc): Bind for 0.0.0.0:3000 failed: port is already allocated."
make sure you dont have any of your containers running on that port you can always check with `docker ps` or `docker ps --all`
